# Python-in-Data-Analytics
Description of the project

The dataset contains information on sales of the company's products, which operates on the global market and sells goods in brick-and-mortar stores and online stores. The dataset consists of three tables:

events.csv — sales for several years
products.csv — product categories and their codes
countries.csv — countries, regions and their codes

The main purpose is data cleaning and intelligence analysis; finding valuable insights into the company's activities; ABC analysis of product categories.

Short roadmap:
1. Data Understanding. Understand the data and its content.
2. Data Cleaning. Work with missing data, incorrect data, anomalies.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis. To make an intelligence analysis is simple statistics, correlation analysis, summary tables, visualization. Use whatever tools are available to you, not necessarily just Python.

What was done:
some key metrics of the company's activity were found: total number of orders, total profit, total number of countries covered;
analyzed sales (profits, popularity of products) by: product categories, geography;
it was analyzed whether the profit depends on the time required for the shipment of the goods;
the dynamics of sales (over time) were analyzed in terms of product categories, countries, and regions;
an analysis of sales of goods by day of the week was carried out.
4. ABC analysis. An ABC analysis was carried out according to the Pareto principle, dividing goods into three categories depending on the profit for the last year. The results of ABC analysis were visualized.
The basis of ABC analysis is the Pareto principle. The ABC analysis method divides goods into three groups. The first group "A" is goods that are in demand, they give the company up to 80% of the turnover. The second group "B" brings 15%, and the third group "C" gives only 5% of the proceeds.
